# Sudoku
This app is a sudoku game and solver

Because the application was developed with a simple IDE (jGrasp) I do not guarantee that it will work on other IDE's as well. Please do not change the names of files as that would make the application unstable.

All classes are written by me, so the ready code has not been received, and it is full of comments in order to be as clear as possible.

This project uses the Backtracking algorithm to solve a sudoku.

The project uses 6 classes and interfaces as seen in the picture below.
The model is MVC where the "Start" and "Game_Controll" classes are the control class, the "Game_Settings", "Open_Window" and "Window" classes are the view class and the others are the model class
